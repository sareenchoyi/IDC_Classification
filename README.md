# Classification of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)

## What is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma? 

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype (accounts for up to 80% of all breast cancers) of all breast cancers. Using a deep learning model to classify positive vs negative classes of IDC has a huge potential to improve diagnosis

## Goal of Deep Learning Model 

-  Build a deep learning model to classify positive and negative IDC cases.
-  Try to implement current SOTA techniques in image segmentation and classification. 

## Datasets Used 

-  [Breast Histopathology Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) Dataset from Kaggle for IDC
- Original dataset: 162 WSI images of BCa specimes, scanned at 40x.
- 277,524 patches of size 50 x 50 were extracted (198,738 IDC negative and 78,786 IDC positive)
