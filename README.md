# Classification of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)

## What is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma? 

Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most common subtype (accounts for up to 80% of all breast cancers) of all breast cancers. Using a deep learning model to classify positive vs negative classes of IDC has a huge potential to improve diagnosis

## Goal of Deep Learning Model 

-  Build a deep learning model to classify positive and negative IDC cases.
-  Try to implement current SOTA techniques in image segmentation and classification.
